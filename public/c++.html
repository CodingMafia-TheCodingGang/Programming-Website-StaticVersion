                C plus plus is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer
                scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it
                has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has object-oriented, generic, and
                functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always
                implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software
                Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.[13]

                C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems
                in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[14] C++ has also
                been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
                resource-constrained applications,[14] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g.
                e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or
                space probes).[15]

                C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known
                as C++20).[16] The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998,
                which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard
                supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization
                in 1998, C++ was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he
                wanted an efficient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for
                program organization.[17] Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release schedule[18] with C++23 as
                the next planned standard.[19]
